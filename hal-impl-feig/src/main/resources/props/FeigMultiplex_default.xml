   <!-- List of readpoints that represent specific antennas
        The name of the readpoint can be chosen arbitrary but it must be unique.
        The map of the readpoint is a vector of channels that represent the path from the reader to the readpoint (antenna).
        The map vector has dimension 3 where each component defines the output channel (0-8) of a multiplexer at levels 1-3.
        Multiplexer levels that are unused for a specific readpoint are set to 0.
        An antenna that is directly attached to the reader can be expressed as the 0-vector 0,0,0. In this case, only one readpoint can be defined. -->
