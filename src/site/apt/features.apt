Features

  The following outlines the features of the Accada HAL Project.

* Accada HAL Modules

  The Accada HAL Project comprises of several modules:

  * the hardware abstraction interface with common utilities

  * a module with simulator variants implementing the hardware abstraction interface

  * modules for each reader device manufacturer containing one or more reader
    controllers implementating the hardware abstraction interface


* Accada Hardware Abstraction Interface Features

  The hardware abstraction standardises the interface to different readers with
  proprietary and thus incompatible interfaces. Even a simulator without any
  hardware can implement the same interface. All implementations of the hardware
  abstraction interface can be treated eqaly and hence are rendered interchangeable.


* Accada HAL Simulator Module

  The simulator module consists of a controller with four possible types of
  simulation:

  * Graphic Simulator

    The graphic simulator provides a GUI that shows a reader with configurable
    amount of antennas. Tags can be created with few mouse clicks. Reading tags
    works like on a hardware reader. When tags are moved over an antenna, they are
    recognised by the reader, after leaving the area of the antenna, they are not
    recognised any more.

  * Batch Simulator

    The batch simulator processes a file with information about tags entering and
    exiting the range of an antenna. Each event consists of a time, the type of
    event, source ID, tag ID and optionally user memory contents of the tag. The
    time describes when the event should happen in milliseconds resolution starting
    at the beginning of the simulation. The type of event is eiter entering or
    exiting the range of the source (antenna). The source ID is the name of the
    source antenna. The tag ID is the UID or EPC of the tag that caused the event.

  * Command Line Simulator

    The command line simulator can be controlled in real time textually over a
    command line. Tags can be added and removed from a source with simple commands.

  * Simulator Client with Simulator Server

    The simulator client connects to a simulator server and receives events over
    the network. The simulator server can run on an other computer and opens a
    graphic simulator for example.


* Implemented Readers

  Following readers are implemented in the Accada HAL:
