Welcome to the Accada HAL Project


* Objective

  The objective of the Accada HAL project is to define a hardware abstraction
  interface that is used to access RFID readers and implement it for various
  reader devices and reader simulators. Accada HAL is used by the Reader 
  and Filtering and Collection project.


* How can the Accada HAL Project help you?

  This project allows you to:

  * access different readers over a uniform interface from your own application

  []

  * easily implement new readers for the {{{../reader/index.html}Accada Reader}}

  []

  * use all the implemented hardware abstractions of readers with the Accada Reader

  []


* Organization

  The Accada HAL Project comprises of several modules:

  * the hardware abstraction interface with common utilities

  []

  * a module for the hardware abstraction interface implemented with simulator
    variants

  []

  * a module for each implementation of the hardware abstraction interface

  []

  The figure below gives an overview of the Accada HAL implementation. For more
  information refer to the {{{docs/developer-index.html}Developer}} section.
